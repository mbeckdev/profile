# My portfolio site

[Check it out here](https://www.mbeckdev.com/)

It's a place I can show people so they can get a little idea of who I am. 

## How It Works

Made with HTML CSS JavaScript, and a sweet canvas animation. I kept it simple so you can check out the code using Chrome DevTools easily.

Hosted on Netlify with a custom domain name. Such a simple way to get a website working. If you don't need to do much backend for a site, I'd definitely recommend it.

## Code Notes

It's a single page design. It's responsive - which means it works on computers and on mobile with slight tweaks to the layout. I mostly used media queries and Flexbox in CSS to help with this. I like Flexbox.

Making that animation at the top uses a \<canvas\> element. That's the only JavaScript I used for this project.  

Note to self: With canvas, make sure you're rendering based off actual time instead of whenever it decides - that way it won't be super fast one time and slow another time.

## Future Improvements

In the future I could remake this whole site with React. It would make the project section a lot easier to deal with on the code side. With plain HTML you have to copy and paste the same code over and over. With React, you could make a component for one project section and reuse it multiple times. So efficient!
